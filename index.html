    <p>There are many fascinating shades of blue, each with its own charm. Cerulean Blue, with its vibrant and deep tone, represents clarity and inspiration. Cornflower Blue is a lighter shade, reminiscent of a summer sky. It evokes a sense of calmness and relaxation. Steel Blue, on the other hand, exudes strength and sophistication.</p>
    
    <p>Blue can be found in the vastness of the ocean, the clear sky, and even in the eyes of some animals. Its presence in nature adds to its allure and makes it an enchanting color.</p>
